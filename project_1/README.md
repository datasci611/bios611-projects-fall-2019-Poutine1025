## Background

The data is provided by Urban Ministries of Durham, of which the people in this organization connect with the community to end homelessness and fight poverty by offering food, shelter and a future to neighbors in need. The data includes 79838 observations and 18 variables.

## Questions

- What is the relationship among Food Pounds, Clothing Items and Number of people in the family for which food was provided?
- How does time influence the amount of food and clothing items?
- What is the amount of food need to be provided in 2019?

Thus, Date, Client File Number, Food Pounds, Clothing Items and Number of people in the family for which food was provided are variables that I think may be useful.

## Analysis approach

One analysis approach I may use is linear regression, by which I can determine whether one variable has significant influence on another.
