##Background

The data is provided by Urban Ministries of Durham, of which the people in this organization connect with the community to end homelessness and fight poverty by offering food, shelter and a future to neighbors in need. The data includes 79838 observations and 18 variables.

##Questions

- Does the amount of money provided to clients vary from year to year?
- Is there any correlation between finacial support and the number of people in the family for which food was provided?
- Is there any correlation between the number of bus tickets and the number of people in the family for which food was provided?

Thus, date service was provided, money provided to clients, number of bus tickets and number of people in the family for which food was provided are variables that I think may be useful.

## Analysis approach

One analysis approach I may use is linear regression, by which I can determine whether one variable has significant influence on another.
